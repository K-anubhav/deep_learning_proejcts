# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains the code and files for a collection of 10 deep learning projects. These projects cover a wide range of topics and techniques in deep learning and are designed to help you gain insights and inspiration for your own projects.

The projects include backpropagation and gradient checking, working with callbacks, document classification with CNN, transfer learning, LSTM on Donors Choose, CNN on CIFAR, NLP with transfer learning, computer vision - segmentation, spoken digit recognition, and NLP attention mechanism.

In addition to the project code, this repository also includes README files that provide an overview of each project, what it does, and how it works. These README files are an important step to make sure others can understand your projects and how to use them.

To get started, simply download the code and files for the project(s) you are interested in and follow the installation and usage instructions provided in the README files. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project.

Thank you for your interest in these deep learning projects!

Below is a brief overview of each project:

## 1. Backpropagation and Gradient Checking

In this project, I implemented the backpropagation algorithm and gradient checking in Python from scratch. The goal was to understand how the backpropagation algorithm works and how to check whether the gradients are being computed correctly.

## 2. Working with Callbacks

In this project, I used callbacks in Keras to monitor and modify the training process of a neural network. The project involved implementing custom callbacks and using pre-defined callbacks in Keras.

## 3. Document Classification with CNN

In this project, I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify documents based on their content. The dataset used was the IMDB movie review dataset, and the goal was to predict whether a review was positive or negative.

## 4. Transfer Learning

In this project, I used transfer learning to train a neural network on a new dataset. The pre-trained model used was VGG16, and the new dataset was the Kaggle cats vs dogs dataset.

## 5. LSTM on Donors Choose

In this project, I used a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict whether a project posted on Donors Choose would be funded or not. The dataset used was the Donors Choose dataset.

## 6. CNN on CIFAR

In this project, I used a CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal was to achieve high accuracy on the test set while minimizing overfitting.

## 7. NLP with Transfer Learning

In this project, I used transfer learning to perform sentiment analysis on the Amazon product reviews dataset. The pre-trained model used was BERT.

## 8. Computer Vision - Segmentation

In this project, I used a U-Net neural network to perform image segmentation on the Kaggle Carvana dataset. The goal was to segment the cars in the images.

## 9. Spoken Digit Recognition

In this project, I used a deep neural network to recognize spoken digits. The dataset used was the Google Speech Commands dataset.

## 10. NLP Attention Mechanism

In this project, I implemented an attention mechanism in a neural network for sentiment analysis. The dataset used was the Twitter sentiment analysis dataset.

Each project has its own folder containing the code and a README file explaining the project in detail.
